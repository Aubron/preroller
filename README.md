# Preroller

A public service utility for creating pre-movie trailer rolls.

This script grabs the top trailers from Apple Trailers, as well as some random Alamo Drafthouse PSAs from this youtube playlist, and cuts one video file that is usually around 20 minutes in length. Trailers and the drafthouse PSAs have been that which I've missed most in transitioning from theaters to using something like Bigscreen for social screenings, and this gives me an opportunity to bring that back.
